# What is CS61B
CS61B, offered by UC Berkeley, is a course on algorithm and data sturcture. Out of interest, I dived into the 18spring version of the course and put my materials here.

The commitment of the professor at UC Berkeley is appreciated. Their work truly adds magic to the CS society and far beyond.
