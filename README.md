# What is CS61B

CS61B, offered by UC Berkeley, is a course on algorithms and data structures. Out of interest, I dived  into the Spring 2018 version of the course in Jan 2025 and have included my materials here.

I appreciate the dedication of the professor at UC Berkeley. Their work truly adds value to the CS community and beyond.
